[![Travis Status](https://travis-ci.org/saucelabs-sample-test-frameworks/Python-Pytest-Selenium.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/saucelabs-sample-test-frameworks/Python-Pytest-Selenium)

*NOTE*: This repository is now deprecated. Please see the [Demo Python](https://github.com/saucelabs-training/demo-python) project for up-to-date code samples.

This code is meant for actual py.test users with aspirations beyond running unittest style tests using py.test.
It demonstrates the use of py.test fixtures in conjunction with Selenium and SauceLabs.

### Environment Setup

1. Global Dependencies
    * [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    * Or Install Python with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
    ```
    $ brew install python
    ```
    * Install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) for package installation

2. Sauce Credentials
    * In the terminal export your Sauce Labs Credentials as environmental variables:
    ```
    $ export SAUCE_USERNAME=<your Sauce Labs username>
	$ export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=<your Sauce Labs access key>
    ```
3. Project
	* The recommended way to run your tests would be in [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). It will isolate the build from other setups you may have running and ensure that the tests run with the specified versions of the modules specified in the requirements.txt file.
	```$ pip install virtualenv```
	* Create a virtual environment in your project folder the environment name is arbitrary.
	```$ virtualenv venv```
	* Activate the environment:
	```$ source venv/bin/activate```
	* Install the required packages:
	```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Running Tests:  -n option designates number of parallel tests and -s to disable output capture.

*  Tests in Parallel:
    ```$ py.test -s -n 2 tests```

* Dump session ids for the SauceLabs CI plugins:
    ```$ cat $(find . -name "*.testlog")```

### Advice/Troubleshooting

There may be additional latency when using a remote webdriver to run tests on Sauce Labs. Timeouts or Waits may need to be increased.

### Resources
##### [Sauce Labs Documentation](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/)

##### [Selenium Documentation](http://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/)

##### [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/2.7/)

##### [Pytest Documentation](http://pytest.org/latest/contents.html)

##### [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
* A great resource to search for issues not explicitly covered by documentation.

### Known Issues:
* Test output will be captured in .testlog files as the pytest-xdist plugin has issues with not capturing stdout and stderr. You can use the following commands to output session id's for CI integration and clean up.
```
$ cat *.testlog
$ rm -rf *.testlog
```
